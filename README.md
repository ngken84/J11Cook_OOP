## Example 1 : Classes

### Notable Discoveries
- RuntimeExceptions do not need to be inside a try-catch block so are useful for making more descriptive errors
- NullPointerExceptions are something you have to pay attention to when making object-oriented designs

## Example 2 : Inner Classes

### There are three types of inner classes
-**Inner class** can access private members of enclosing class and vice versa; private members or private class itself is not accessible from outside
-**Method-local inner class** class is defined inside a method. Accessible only within the method
-**Anonymous inner class** defined without a name and defined during instantiation based on an interface or extended class
